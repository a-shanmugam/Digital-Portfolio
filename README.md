# Web Technology Course - Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for the **Web Technology Course**! This repository is where you'll build your portfolio website, applying the web development skills learned throughout the course.

## Project Overview

In this project, you'll create a personal portfolio website using the **Django** framework. The website will serve as a showcase for your skills, projects, and achievements. You'll follow a structured approach to learn and apply the fundamental principles of web development, including:

- Setting up Django
- Building dynamic web pages
- Creating a database-driven website
- Styling with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

   git clone <repository-url>
2. **Set up a virtual environment (optional)** and install Django:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install django
3. **Start the Django project:**
    ```bash
    django-admin startproject portfolio
    cd portfolio
    python manage.py runserver
4. Begin by customizing the website with your information (projects, skills, about me, etc.).
