In each of it’s four parts it asks you to rate your ability in different skills and how important they are to you. My result: I need to work on my managing and team working skills.\r\n\r\nBefore taking the test I was already aware that my personal time management skills could use some improvement, and I’ve been working on it since I began studying at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland. I’ve gone from basically no time and task managing system other than my brain to a set of helpful strategies and currently, I’m looking into alternatives to calendars for managing my daily schedule to further boost my productivity.\r\n\r\nTeam working comprises actively participating in the team, encouraging co-operation, awareness of other’s needs, information sharing and prioritizing team goals over individual ones. In an effort to improve my team working skills I attended the university course called “collaboration in teams” during which I worked on the topic of mental models and what modes of communication are best fit for given tasks. Mental models comprise the ideas that individual team members have about the common task, processes, and roles of the other team members.\r\n\r\nAnd even though I made great progress in these areas
